The Python Calculator is a command-line based calculator script designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. This project showcases fundamental features of Python, demonstrating the language's simplicity and versatility in implementing functional programs. The calculator employs a user-friendly interface with ASCII art to enhance the visual experience.

Features:

User Interface: The calculator features a visually appealing ASCII art representation, creating an engaging and interactive user interface. This not only serves a functional purpose but also highlights the creative side of Python programming.

Basic Operations: The calculator supports four basic arithmetic operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input numeric values and select an operation to obtain the result.

Function Implementation: The code demonstrates the use of functions in Python. Each arithmetic operation is encapsulated within a function, promoting modular and organized code structure.

Dictionary Usage: The project utilizes a dictionary to map mathematical operation signs to corresponding functions. This approach enhances code readability and showcases Python's ability to work with complex data structures.

Looping and Conditional Statements: The script utilizes a while loop to allow users to perform multiple calculations in a single run. It also incorporates conditional statements to determine if the user wishes to continue with additional calculations or exit the program.

Error Handling: The script includes basic error handling, converting user inputs to float type to handle potential input errors gracefully.

Overall, the Python Calculator project is a testament to the simplicity and effectiveness of Python in implementing practical and interactive command-line applications. The combination of ASCII art, functions, and data structures showcases the language's suitability for a wide range of programming tasks, from basic calculations to more complex projects
